# A Crowdfunding Campaign You Can’t Refuse

## Abstract

The rise of crowdfunding platforms allow us to turn our creative thoughts into real-world products. To facilitate this process and create benefits for both project owners and backers, we present a new methodology to analyze the success patterns of Kickstarter’s campaigns. We dive deep into the historical data and extract insights from Tableau visualization. Furthermore, we relate Kickstarter to Amazon and Twitter datasets. Knowledge from the large corpus of Amazon can provide us for a better understanding of Kickstarter. For example, useful keywords can be generated by computing the similarity between documents. We further use machine learning and deep learning models to predict the outcome of a campaign and achieve 73.1% AUC score with random forest. Our analysis results serve as useful tips when ones try to launch a campaign.
